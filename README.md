# pressy-client

`pressy-client` is a simple library for using WordPress's XML-RPC API. It's made to be used by Pressy, a command-line tool for working with your WordPress site using local files on disk.

## Installation

`pressy-client` is not yet published as a RubyGem. Pressy pulls `pressy-client` in directly from the Git sources at the moment, as it makes development easier.

<!--

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pressy-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pressy-client

-->

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
